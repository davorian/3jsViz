1. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Wait for the 3D scene to load** - you'll see the Quantum logo and loading indicator
3. **Start exploring** the four interactive demos

## Interactive Features

### Navigation Controls (Bottom Left)
- **Four Demo Buttons**: Each represents a different Quantum film property
  - ðŸŒŠ **Puncture Resistance** - Shows impact and stress resistance
  - âž– **Stretch Up** - Demonstrates elasticity and stretching
  - â­• **Cling Increase** - Shows adhesion and surface interaction
  - â¬œ **Retention** - Displays long-term holding power

- **Play/Pause Control**: Start or stop the current demo animation
- **Wave Visualizer**: Shows animated audio waves when demo is playing

### 3D Scene Interaction
- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate the 3D view around the film
- **Mouse Scroll**: Zoom in and out of the scene
- **Auto-rotation**: Scene gently rotates when not interacting

### Information Panel (Right Side)
- **Demo Description**: Detailed explanation of the current test
- **Performance Highlights**: Key benefits and specifications
- **Smooth Transitions**: Panel slides in when switching demos

## Demo Descriptions

### ðŸŒŠ Puncture Resistance Demo
**What you'll see:**
- Semi-transparent film surface
- Red impact point that pulses and moves
- Golden particle effects showing stress distribution
- Film slightly rotates to show resistance

**Key Features:**
- Superior puncture resistance
- Withstands sharp objects
- Maintains integrity under pressure

### âž– Stretch Up Demo
**What you'll see:**
- Film that stretches horizontally while maintaining volume
- Golden stretch indicators on the sides
- Smooth scaling animation showing elasticity
- Material conservation visualization

**Key Features:**
- Unprecedented elasticity
- Stretches further without tearing
- Reduced material usage

### â­• Cling Increase Demo
**What you'll see:**
- Film with undulating wave surface effects
- Dark adhesion surface underneath
- Dynamic surface interaction patterns
- Smooth wave animations across the film

**Key Features:**
- Enhanced adhesion formula
- Secure adherence
- Prevents unwrapping during transport

### â¬œ Retention Demo
**What you'll see:**
- Brown box representing wrapped product
- Golden retention bands around the package
- Gentle pulsing animation showing stability
- Subtle rotation demonstrating long-term hold

**Key Features:**
- Long-term holding power
- Maintains tight bundling
- Ideal for extended storage

## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Use Chrome or Firefox** for best WebGL performance
2. **Enable hardware acceleration** in your browser
3. **Try different zoom levels** to see details
4. **Let each demo play** for a few seconds to see full animation cycle
5. **Switch between demos** to compare different properties
6. **Use headphones** for the full audio-visual experience (wave visualizers)

## Troubleshooting

**If the 3D scene doesn't load:**
- Check if WebGL is enabled in your browser
- Try refreshing the page
- Ensure you have a modern browser version

**If animations are choppy:**
- Close other browser tabs
- Check if hardware acceleration is enabled
- Try zooming out for better performance

**If controls don't respond:**
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled
- Try clicking directly on the demo buttons
- Refresh the page if needed

## Technical Notes

- Built with React Three Fiber for smooth 3D rendering
- Uses Framer Motion for UI animations
- Optimized for 60fps performance
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- No audio files needed - visual wave simulation only

Enjoy exploring the revolutionary Quantum Stretch Film technology!
